# Learn

I guess it's time to probably put some sort of text here since there's a chance people stumble on this. This repo is a collection of articles/tech help/etc. of stuff I've done over the years and figured well... since I've been to over 90 hackathons at this point and plan to keep going to more, I'll be saying the same stuff over and over again.

With this repo, I can just write it down once, and just send it out. As I get feedback from peeps over time, I'll slowly update/deprecate them as I see fit. I still have a job and various other committments in my life so it's not meant to always be perfect but at the very least passable.

### Why not post these on medium or anything of the like?

I think sites like Medium are limiting in what they offer - they're meant to be articles but I see my tutorials as more than just a light read. I intend for them to be more and more interactive so that learning becomes and experience. That's why I have my own custom markdown renderer as well as a fairly bespoke setup.

### Contributing

I don't think I've ever had anyone express interest in contributing but I guess if you want to (see a typo or something like that), feel free to open up a PR with the edits you'd like to make and I'll be happy to review them.
