So that begs the question, what is an event? An event can be anything: a button click, a page load, mouse hover, or even something set on a timer. Events are a way for developers to bring interactivity to the webpage. After every event, a developer can make read the metadata about that event, and choose to act on it. Let's take a look at how we would do this:\n\n## Prerequisites\n- Basic HTML\n- Basic Javascript\n- Understand how to reference HTML objects from Javascript\n\n## Types of events\n\nThere's a HUGE list of different types of events in the browser - like I said earlier, an event can be *anything* - but we'll focus on some of the most common ones here and learn how to use them, which you can then extrapolate to any other type of event.\n\nYou can find the whole list here: [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events)\n\n| Event type | Interactions |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| User device | Moving the mouse, pressing the keyboard, touch screen, pressing connected joystick/gamepad |  |\n| DOM element | Clicking a button, hovering over a div with the mouse, moving a slider, inputting text into a form |\n| Async/Callbacks| Loading in assets (3d objects, for ex.), fetching data from an API, streaming video, recording audio |\n\n\n## Reacting to events\n\nRunning code in response to an event boils down to two main parts: listening to events, and handling them.\n\nEven though events are triggered by a multitude of actions, you can't interact with any of them until you start *listening* to them. To *listen* and *handle* an event, you need to attach an [EventListener](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener) to an object and pass in a handler function. There are three main parts to it:\n\n```html index.html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>Event fun!</title>\n    <script src=\"./script.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <button id=\"btn\">Click me!</button>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\n```js script.js\nconst button = document.getElementById('btn');\n\nfunction clicked() {\n    console.log('This button has been clicked');\n}\n\nbutton.addEventListener('click', clicked);\n\n```\n\nOn line 1: I create a variable called `button` and set it equal to the DOM element. This means that when I'm using the `button` variable, I am pretty much referencing the button that is displayed on the website.\n\nOn line 3: I create a function called `clicked`. I can call the function by running `clicked()` - adding the parenthesis after, indicating I want to `call` the function.\n\nOn line 7: I add an event listener by calling the `addEventListener()` function that's a part of every HTML element and specify 2 things in the parameters: the `type of event` and the `callback function` that triggers when the attached event is triggered.\n\nOne thing to note here, when you're passing the function into the `addEventListener`, you **must** omit the `()`. The `()` means that you want to call the function immediately, when in fact, what you want is to pass the *reference* of the function to the event listener so that **they** can call it when the event gets triggered. (By **they**, I mean the browser)\n\n### Other elements\n\nEven though a button is normally associated with clicking, you can actually attach the `click` handler onto pretty much any element. You could attach it to an `<img />` element or a `<div></div>` - the sky's the limit. Similarly, you can attach other types of events (some listed below) like keyboard input event or mouse overs.\n\n```html index.html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>Event fun!</title>\n    <script src=\"./script.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"div\">Click me!</div>\n    <p id=\"p\">Click me!</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\n```js script.js\nconst div = document.getElementById('div');\nconst p = document.getElementById('p');\n\nfunction clicked() {\n    console.log('This button has been clicked');\n}\n\ndiv.addEventListener('click', clicked);\np.addEventListener('click', clicked);\n\n```\n\n## Common event examples\n\nHere are some of the more common event handling situations you might have:\n\n### Clicking a button\nExtremely common, straightforward\n\n```html index.html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>Event fun!</title>\n    <script src=\"./script.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <button id=\"btn\">Click me!</btn>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\n```js script.js\nconst button = document.getElementById('btn');\n\nfunction clicked() {\n    console.log('This button has been clicked');\n}\n\nbutton.addEventListener('click', clicked);\n\n```\n\n### Taking in user input\n\nExample use case: when a user is typing into a search bar and clicks a button to submit\n\n```html index.html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>Event fun!</title>\n    <script src=\"./script.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <input type=\"text\" id=\"user-input\" />\n    <button id=\"btn\">Click me!</btn>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\n```js script.js\nconst button = document.getElementById('btn');\n\nfunction clicked() {\n    // use the .value property to get the user typed value in the textbox\n    const userInput = document.getElementById('user-input').value;\n\n    console.log('The user typed this:', userInput);\n    // likely you want to do something with `userInput`\n}\n\nbutton.addEventListener('click', clicked);\n\n```\n\n### Reacting to user input\n\nThe example above shows you how to read the user input after the user submits what they wanted to type. If you want an even higher level of control over the text box, you can use the `onchange` event handler to get the user typed values as they're typing into a text box.\n\nExample: There are a ton of use cases here: you could write a handle change function here that only allows numbers and capital letters by reading the user typed letter and deciding whether or not to allow it. You could also write an autocomplete function that suggests options as a user is typing into a search bar.\n\nEssentially, the `onchange` event from an `<input />` tag gets triggered whenever the content inside it gets changed (either by typing, backspacing, or even clearing from select all + backspace)\n\n```html index.html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>Event fun!</title>\n    <script src=\"./script.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <input type=\"text\" id=\"user-input\" />\n    <button id=\"btn\">Click me!</btn>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\n```js script.js\nconst input = document.getElementById('user-input');\n\nfunction handleChange(event) {\n    console.log('The user typed this:', userInput);\n}\n\ninput.addEventListener('change', handleChange);\n\n```\n\n\n### Keyboard events\n\nKeyboard events are a HUGE part of any web application. Sometimes, the web app can be completely centered around keyboard events. For example, games are the biggest users when it comes to keyboard events. Arrow keys and W/A/S/D are very often used as movement commands and are integral to any game. Even business applications like Excel/Figma/Google Docs rely heavily on keyboard events - imagine using any of those without common hotkeys like `Ctrl + C` or `Ctrl + V`.\n\nWhat's the difference between what I'm about to show you and the one above? The one above is only relevant to the input tag (so if you type outside of it, it won't register) but also, there are tons of keys that don't work inside an input tag like the `Enter` key, Arrow keys, and `Cmd` on Mac or `Alt` on Windows.\n\n```html index.html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>Event fun!</title>\n    <script src=\"./script.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <input type=\"text\" id=\"user-input\" />\n    <button id=\"btn\">Click me!</btn>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\n```js script.js\nconst input = document.getElementById('user-input');\n\nfunction handleChange(event) {\n    console.log('The user typed this:', userInput);\n}\n\ninput.addEventListener('change', handleChange);\n\n```\n\n### Data Fetching events\n\nSometimes, you'll want to fetch data from an external source, usually in response to some sort of user interaction. In this next example, imagine you have a text box for users to search for restaurants within a certain area.\n\n```html index.html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>Event fun!</title>\n    <script src=\"./script.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <input type=\"text\" id=\"user-input\" />\n    <button id=\"btn\">Click me!</btn>\n  </body>\n</html>\n\n```\n\n```js script.js\nfunction getRestaurants(location){\n  const API_ENDPOINT = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryqndev/learn-ryqn-dev/main/src/content/tutorial/web-dev/fundamentals/events/fake-api/irvine-restaurants.json'\n\n  fetch(API_ENDPOINT).then((res) => res.json()).then(response => {\n    console.log(response);\n  });\n}\n```"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
