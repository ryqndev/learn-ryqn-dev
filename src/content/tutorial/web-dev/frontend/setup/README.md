## Overview

## Tech stack

Just so we're all on the same page, let's make sure we know what a tech stack is. A tech stack is pretty much just the entire list of languages, libraries, frameworks, and technologies that are all used in a product or application. Knowing what tech stack is being used allows you to do a multitude of things immediately:

-   If you're applying for a job, this allows you to know if your skill set is an immediate good fit
-   or, if the job/company is of interest to you but their tech stack doesn't overlap with your skills, you know what you'll need to pick up
-   When you're at a hackathon and trying to come up with what to make, folks often figure out what languages everyone's familiar with first, and then decide a tech stack from that, and then that tech stack helps them guide what they'll be making.

If you ever hear people say things like:

> ...React frontend served over Next.js and a Node.js backend...

> ...Vue frontend with a Flask backend and a Mongo database...

> ...PHP CMS supported by a MySQL database hosted on Azure...

> ...mixture of Python machine learning instances running TensorFlow hosted on AWS Lambda and Go microservices with an Envoy proxy hosted on a multi-region AWS EC2 instance served to a Svelte frontend with high performance modules written in WASM and WebGL...

These are tech stacks being listed and knowing
