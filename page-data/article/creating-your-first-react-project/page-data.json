This is where all of our files will go. If you haven't done so already, open this folder up in the terminal and type the command `npx create-react-app .` - An example of this process will look something like this: (If you are on windows and want to follow these Unix commands, you can [switch your terminal to Bash](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42606837/how-do-i-use-bash-on-windows-from-the-visual-studio-code-integrated-terminal))\n\n```bash terminal\n$ ls\nApplications\tDocuments\tMovies\nDownloads\t    Desktop\t\tLibrary\t\n\n$ cd Desktop\n\n$ mkdir react-test\n\n$ cd Desktop\n\n$ npx create-react-app .\nCreating a new React app in /Users/Ryan/Desktop/react-test.\n\nInstalling packages. This might take a couple of minutes.\nInstalling react, react-dom, and react-scripts with cra-template...\n\n...\n```\nHere, I `cd` (Change Directory) into my Desktop directory and create a folder called react-test. Then I `cd` into that folder I just created and run the command `npx create-react-app .`. \n> *Note: The `.` at the end of `npx create-react-app .` just means \"in this folder\" but you can type a folder name instead and it will create a folder for you.*\n\nThe files will take some time depending on your internet speeds, computer hardware, etc. but also whether or not this is your first time installing. \n\nIf everything has finished correctly, you should have something like this:\n```file\n└── react-test\n    ├── node_modules\n    │   └── ...stuff\n    ├── public\n    │   ├── index.html\n    │   └── ...stuff\n    ├── src\n    │   ├── index.js\n    │   ├── App.js\n    │   └── ...stuff\n    ├── package.json\n    ├── README.md\n    └── ...problably other stuff\n```\n...stuff denotes may or may not have extra stuff but we don't that much yet\n\n### Running our test server\n\nIf all of this is good, then you can probably run a development server really quick by typing in your terminal\n```bash terminal\n$ npm start\n\nCompiled successfully!\n\nYou can now view [folder name] in the browser.\n\n  Local:            http://localhost:3001\n  On Your Network:  http://[your local ip]:3001\n\nNote that the development build is not optimized.\nTo create a production build, use yarn build.\n\n```\n![vscode screenshot of running the code](./assets/running.png)\n*mine is running on port :3001 because I have something on :3000 at the moment*\n\nand it should open up `http://localhost:3000` in your browser. If not, you can just enter `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to access your site.\n\n![test site running on local server](./assets/result.png)\n\nTo stop the development server, you can just type [Ctrl + C] in the terminal to close it.\n\n### About CRA\n\nThe terminal command we typed to generate the entire boilerplate code: `npx create-react-app [folder name/location]` does a little more than just download React for us. You'll often see this abbreviated in articles as [CRA](https://create-react-app.dev/) and it sets up a *production* level environment for us and is the easiest way to get coding in React. Here's an incomplete and simplified list of things it does:\n\n • Initialize npm - makes that node_modules folder and package.json that allows you install libraries with a simple command (something I'll demo later)\n\n • Setup basic scripts - commands like `npm start` and `npm build` that setup an entire testing platform with hot reloading and compiling prod files\n \n • Setup webpack - bundles all your files into one and only imports things you need\n \n • Setup Babel - generates polyfills (code that makes your code backwards compatible and work on all browsers)\n \n • ... bunch of other stuff but the ones above are most important\n\nDo I need CRA to run React? No, but it's *extremely* helpful in getting projects up and running. In fact, it's not recommended to run React without CRA unless you really know what you're doing.\n\nFor every new React project, you'll likely be typing `npx create-react-app [folder name]` so it sets everything up nice for you.\n\n## Ready to learn React\n\nNow that we have our entire setup ready, we can finally start getting into learning React! I would first recommend learning a lil' about [vanilla web development in plain HTML/CSS/JS](https://learn.ryqn.dev/article/intro-to-web-dev) so you that when you start getting into React, you can see the benefits and understand why devs in the industry use React.\n\n\n"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
