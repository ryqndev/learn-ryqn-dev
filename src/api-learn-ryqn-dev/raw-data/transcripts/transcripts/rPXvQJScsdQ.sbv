0:00:00.030,0:00:04.410
so earlier what we did was we 

0:00:02.610,0:00:06.029
just typed in an exclamation mark and

0:00:04.410,0:00:07.859
then we saw a bunch of magic happen up

0:00:06.029,0:00:11.160
on the screen so I'm just gonna go over

0:00:07.859,0:00:13.740
exactly what we did. First thing was

0:00:11.160,0:00:16.410
we can do either exclamation mark or we

0:00:13.740,0:00:19.020
can just type in html:5 and

0:00:16.410,0:00:21.420
what this is is this called an Emmett

0:00:19.020,0:00:24.480
abbreviation and this is just like a way

0:00:21.420,0:00:27.210
to write code faster so instead of

0:00:24.480,0:00:30.179
having to type out this entire code

0:00:27.210,0:00:31.890
snippet we just type in a tag that will

0:00:30.179,0:00:34.590
automatically generate it all for us and

0:00:31.890,0:00:36.809
so this is the general boilerplate code

0:00:34.590,0:00:39.210
that you will see let's go over this

0:00:36.809,0:00:41.850
line by line so we understand what every

0:00:39.210,0:00:45.660
line does the first one is going to be a

0:00:41.850,0:00:47.670
tag that says doctype HTML and what this

0:00:45.660,0:00:50.190
does is it actually just specifies that

0:00:47.670,0:00:52.020
this document although we already know

0:00:50.190,0:00:54.030
it's an HTML file from the file

0:00:52.020,0:00:55.860
extension up here we don't know which

0:00:54.030,0:00:58.559
version of HTML so this kind of

0:00:55.860,0:01:00.570
specifies that it's html5 if you see an

0:00:58.559,0:01:03.149
HTML 4 it's gonna be like something

0:01:00.570,0:01:05.100
really long or if there's an XHTML tag

0:01:03.149,0:01:07.409
but for all purposes we're only gonna be

0:01:05.100,0:01:10.080
doing HTML 5 and that's pretty much what

0:01:07.409,0:01:12.360
everybody develops in going on we have

0:01:10.080,0:01:15.450
these two tags on line 2 and line 12

0:01:12.360,0:01:17.880
what you'll see in HTML is that every

0:01:15.450,0:01:20.610
single opening tag will be followed by a

0:01:17.880,0:01:22.439
closing tag with some exceptions such as

0:01:20.610,0:01:25.740
these meta tags here but just know that

0:01:22.439,0:01:27.330
this is how we position things to say

0:01:25.740,0:01:29.130
that something is inside of something or

0:01:27.330,0:01:31.560
next to something so in this case all

0:01:29.130,0:01:35.250
the content inside here is inside the

0:01:31.560,0:01:37.259
HTML tags this is just to say that the

0:01:35.250,0:01:40.860
language that this webpage is based on

0:01:37.259,0:01:43.409
is English and this is all like

0:01:40.860,0:01:45.600
generated code so this doctype HTML HTML

0:01:43.409,0:01:48.540
head and body this is something that

0:01:45.600,0:01:50.040
you'll see on every single web page but

0:01:48.540,0:01:52.409
the more important content inside this

0:01:50.040,0:01:54.899
HTML file is going to be the head

0:01:52.409,0:01:57.030
section and the body section so every

0:01:54.899,0:01:59.729
HTML tag is going to have a head section

0:01:57.030,0:02:03.299
and a body section and what the head is

0:01:59.729,0:02:05.340
is for metadata about your website so in

0:02:03.299,0:02:07.229
this case we have something called a

0:02:05.340,0:02:08.910
title so if you actually really just go

0:02:07.229,0:02:12.150
on any website you'll see that they all

0:02:08.910,0:02:13.800
have a title so for example google the

0:02:12.150,0:02:15.750
title is actually this top bar

0:02:13.800,0:02:17.790
right here as you can see it's really

0:02:15.750,0:02:21.030
not a part of the actual website which

0:02:17.790,0:02:23.550
is this entire webpage here it's really

0:02:21.030,0:02:25.710
just metadata about it and also stuff if

0:02:23.550,0:02:28.050
you were to Google something let's say

0:02:25.710,0:02:29.940
we Google Google you'll see that there's

0:02:28.050,0:02:32.810
a bunch of text here and then this is

0:02:29.940,0:02:36.420
actually information that will be

0:02:32.810,0:02:38.760
specified in a meta tag over here so as

0:02:36.420,0:02:41.370
you can see like information that shows

0:02:38.760,0:02:43.620
up on a search engine that's obviously

0:02:41.370,0:02:44.850
not really information that goes on your

0:02:43.620,0:02:46.410
website but it's really information

0:02:44.850,0:02:48.470
about your website and so that's

0:02:46.410,0:02:51.150
metadata that goes inside your head tag

0:02:48.470,0:02:54.780
other things I will put in here or like

0:02:51.150,0:02:56.910
links to other JavaScript code CSS code

0:02:54.780,0:02:58.410
and that kind of stuff but for the most

0:02:56.910,0:03:00.210
part just know that everything that goes

0:02:58.410,0:03:03.030
inside the head doesn't necessarily show

0:03:00.210,0:03:06.120
up on the website the body on the other

0:03:03.030,0:03:07.800
hand is exactly everything that goes on

0:03:06.120,0:03:09.870
the website so for example if you're on

0:03:07.800,0:03:13.050
the Google you see all of this text all

0:03:09.870,0:03:15.090
at this logo these buttons these links

0:03:13.050,0:03:17.100
all these things that will all belong

0:03:15.090,0:03:18.959
inside the body and so whatever we type

0:03:17.100,0:03:22.910
in the body will be automatically

0:03:18.959,0:03:22.910
displayed in our website
