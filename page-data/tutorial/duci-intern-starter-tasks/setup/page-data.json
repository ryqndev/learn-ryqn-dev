I'm super duper excited to have you and can't wait to get to work with you. Hopefully, by the end of the program, you'll not only be able to take on tasks for the club, but you've been able to gain enough skills to consider yourself a web developer. Similar to internships in corporate, we'll be following best practices not just coding-wise, but also in collaborating with co-workers and furthering the interests of the club.\n\n### Club Obligations\n\nAs an intern of the board, you're required to attend all board meetings. This is so you can stay in the loop with all the other parts of the club and events. By being a part of the board (or if you're working at any company), you are invested in the success of the larger project you are building and your contributions aren't limited to just the code. If the topic at hand is coming up with next quarter's merch, feel free to chime in with your own ideas!\n\nIf you cannot make an meeting for any reason, you must let either the president or vice president know beforehand.\n\n### Collaboration\n\nCollaborating with other teams at Design@UCI is done through Slack. Please make sure you have Slack accessible, as well as notifications turned on so that you're reachable. Slack, by default, has notification settings that won't ping you outside work hours (9-5) and wait until work hours begins. This is the norm at most companies and similarly, we don't expect board members to have to work early or late hours unless it's for an event (school events are usually late to not coincide with class) or have tight deadlines (shouldn't normally happen).\n\n### Developers\n\nAs a member of the web team, you should have access to the main codebase and be familiar with how to use our systems. As interns, however, it's likely that you'll be coming in without this knowledge. I'll be teaching you along the way so that not only will you know *how* to do things, but also *why* we need to do them.\n\nThe list of technologies we currently work with are as follows:\n\n- HTML/CSS/JS\n- React.js\n- SASS\n- Node/NPM\n- basic terminal commands\n- Git/Github\n\nMost importantly, before we start anything, we want to make sure we have our developer environments set up. Follow the checklist below and when that's all done, we can move on to our [next starter task](/tutorial/duci-intern-starter-tasks/adding-your-profile).\n\n## Checklist\n\n\n- [x] Reading this doc\n- [ ] Create a Github Account\n- [ ] Ask an admin to add your account to the Design@UCI organization\n- [ ] Ensure you have Git installed\n- [ ] Clone the [codebase](https://github.com/designatuci/DUCI-website) by running \n    ```git clone https://github.com/designatuci/DUCI-website.git``` \n    in your terminal\n- [ ] Navigate to the root directory of the codebase: ```cd DUCI-website```\n- [ ] Ensure you have NPM/Node installed \n- [ ] Run `npm install` in the root directory of the codebase\n- [ ] After installing the libraries, run the dev server with ```npm start```\n- [ ] Open up [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in the browser to verify the site is running\n\nOnce you have the dev server running, you can move on to the next task!\n\nIf you have any questions or are running into any issues, don't hesitate to reach me on any of my socials. Your success is my priority.\n\n\n## Next Step\n\nNow, we can add our profiles: [Adding your profile](/tutorial/duci-intern-starter-tasks/adding-your-profile)\n"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
