API is a general term but at hackathons, we will mostly be dealing with \nWeb API's.\n\n## API / Application Programming Interface\n\nThe definition for API in general is simply a way for two pieces of software to communicate with one another (keyword: interface). Web API's are a subset of API's that in which the two pieces of software use HTTP requests to communicate. This definition is still pretty confusing so let's take a look at an example.\n\nSpotify is a digital streaming service that streams music. Because of this business model, they need to have a database of pretty much every single song in the world. Spotify also offers a Web API that allows developers to *communicate* with their service through http requests. For example, if you want to have a feature in which a user can search for songs, you can use the Spotify Web API Browse endpoint.\n\n## How can we use API's?\n\nAPI's can be used to access data from different sources and services, and to automate processes. For example, you can use an API to access financial data from the stock market, or to access weather data. You can also use an API to integrate services like payment processing, SMS messaging, and email into your applications. You can also use an API to access remote databases, to create interactive charts, or to create custom reports. Finally, you can use an API to automate tasks like data processing, data mining, and machine learning.\n\nA good example  is the Google Maps API which allows developers to embed Google Maps into their web applications and to access the map data. This allows developers to create custom applications that can display maps, such as a real-estate application that can display properties on a map or a travel application that can show routes and distances between two points.\n\nAnother good example is the Twitter API, which allows developers to search for tweets and to access user profile information. This allows developers to create applications that can display and analyze trends, or to create applications that can monitor user conversations and display them in real-time.\n\nNotice the difference between these two example API's. The Google Maps API provides an entire built-in component (the map component) that you can jam into your application whereas Twitter API, on the other hand, provides raw data from the Twitter database like tweets, users, etc. that you can then use however you'd like: be it writing a data science application that analyzes frequencies of tweets or even your own custom wrapper to Twitter.\n\n##

Most API services charge developers based on the number of calls made but have a free tier (you can usually stay in free tier for the duration of a hackathon). For example, the Google Maps API offers an endpoint that will return the speed limit given a road segment that is priced at $20 USD per 1000 calls ($0.02 per call). Sometimes, it's not based off of profit. Riot Games (creators of a popular game called League of Legends) offer an API that allow you to search player ranks, match histories, etc. free of charge (with a limit) so people can develop third party software for them. Notice that player lookups are all 3rd party (op.gg, blitz, mobalytics, etc.)\n\nAPI's that require payment will usually have a free tier that allow you to use the API for free as long as you stay under a certain number of calls because they want you to try out their service first so if you decide to continue working on an app and gets popular, they will eventually make a profit. \n\nIn general, companies offer API's to increase the exposure of their services, and to give developers an easier way to access their data. They also offer API's to encourage developers to build useful applications that use their services. This allows companies to expand their reach into new markets, and to get more customers. \n"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
