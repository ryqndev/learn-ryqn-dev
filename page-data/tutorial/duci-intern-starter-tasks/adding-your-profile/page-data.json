Truth to be told, most of the requests we need to follow are going to be pretty boring. Sometimes our tasks as a web developer can be as menial as doing basic data entry - which is what adding your profile amounts to. In fact, *because* this task is so basic, it's actually representative of a well designed system. \n\n### Well designed systems\n\nIn our codebase, we separate the code from the actual data. This is usually what you'll see in most web application architectures. When we're writing React code, our job is to write transformation logic. i.e. how should a browser transform raw data into visual components like so:\n\n| Raw Data | Visual Components |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![board raw json data](./assets/raw.png) | ![rendered React component from json data](./assets/board.png) |\n\n```jsx transformation logic\n// import raw json board member data (snippet posted above)\nimport CURRENT_BOARD from 'assets/data/currentBoard.json';\n\n// Since board member data is an array of objects, we \"map\" every object in the array\n// to a visual component according to the HTML code below\n{CURRENT_BOARD.map((member, i) => (\n    <div className={cn.container} key={i}>\n        <img\n            src={require(`assets/images/board/current/${data.photo}`).default}\n            alt={data.name + ' headshot'}\n        />\n        <p>\n            {data.name}\n            <span>{data.position}</span>\n        </p>\n\n        <div className={cn.socials}>\n            {data.links?.map(({ type, href }) => (\n                <a\n                    key={href}\n                    target='_blank'\n                    rel='noopener noreferrer'\n                    href={href}\n                >\n                    <Icon hoverable src={`nav-${type}.svg`} w='20' h='20' />\n                </a>\n            ))}\n        </div>\n    </div>\n))}\n```\n\n### What does the above code do?\n\nYou don't need to worry about what any of this code is doing (we'll learn about this alter), just the general idea of it. Notice, we take the raw array data of board members and for every one of them, we create HTML instructions on how to display it. \n\nIf you're curious:\n\nLine 6: `CURRENT_BOARD` is the array of raw board data.\nLine 8: The first thing we render is their profile picture. The raw board data has information regarding the name of the image file and so we take that value and plug it into an `<img />` component.\n\nLine 13: Display the board members' name.\nLine 14: Display the board members' position.\n\nLine 16-27: Members can optionally have up to 3 social links. We once again utilize the `.map()` function to dynamically create social icon links for every member.\n\nThe only thing to take note of is the data structure (a.k.a. schema) in which we store the data in. The format in which the data is stored in is important and will break if even a single object in the array does not follow the schema.\n\nThe schema for board members (and intern board members alike) is as follows:\n\n```json BoardMembers\nCURRENT_BOARD = BoardMember[]\n```\n\n```json BoardMember schema\n{\n    \"name\": string,\n    \"position\": string,\n    \"photo\": string,\n    \"links\": SocialLink[]\n}\n```\n```json SocialLink schema\n{\n    \"type\": \"instagram\" | \"linkedin\" | \"website\",\n    \"href\": string\n}\n```\n\nYou can look at the other entries in the data files to figure out what is correct but in general, what the above means is: we have this piece of data called `CURRENT_BOARD` or `CURRENT_BOARD_INTERNS` that contains 1 piece of data: an Array of `BoardMember` objects.\n\nThe next question is, what is the schema of a `BoardMember` object? Well, it has 4 properties: `name`, `position`, `photo` and `links`. Now the first 3 properties have a value of string type but links has a type of `SocialLink` array.\n\nThen, we ask, what's the schema of a `SocialLink`? Well it's a small object with only 2 properties: `type` and `href`. `href` is a string but what is `type`? `type` is essentially a string value except there are only 3 valid strings: `\"instagram\"`, `\"linkedin\"` and `\"website\"`. This is because our code will use this value to determine which icon to use.\n\n\n## Adding your data\n\nSorry, I got a little sidetracked. Anyways, you'll find that our codebase is separated into 2 main parts: `app` and `assets`. `app` is where we have most of our code and essentially the transformation logic. `assets` is where we store all of our site data like board members, events, merch, etc. You might be asking, why don't we have a database for this? You're right in asking why we don't have a database as this is a perfect use case for one and the answer is: it's a lot of extra work to maintain and costs money to host.\n\n### Finding the data files\n\n```file Design@UCI website repo\nDUCI-website\n├── public \n│   ├── static\n│   │   └── ...various assets\n│   └── index.html\n├── src\n│   ├── app\n│   └── assets\n│       └── data\n│           ├── alumniBoard.json\n│           ├── currentBoard.json\n│           ├── currentBoardInterns.json\n│           ├── merchList.json\n│           ├── resources.json\n│           └── socials.json\n├── .gitignore\n├── package.json \n└── README.md\n```\n\nThe above is a brief overview of the code repository (i.e. some files and folders not shown). The place we'll be looking at specifically is `DUCI-website/src/assets/data/currentBoardInterns.json`. Go ahead and open that file up in your favorite code editor.\n\n## Adding your profile\n\n### Upload your assets\n\nWhat does every profile have? It has a profile picture, a name, a position, and a list of links. That means that we need to add every single one of those things into our code. 3 of these properties are just text data that we can type in but images and other assets follow a slightly different method. This is because we can't (and shouldn't) embed our images directly into our HTML code. We pass in a reference to where the image asset is located and tell the browser to render it after we load the main website code.\n\nWhen you open up the file, you should see a well-formed JSON object in the form of an array. This is the list of intern board members. Add yourself to the very end of it while following the syntax from the other members above.\n\nOne thing to note though, make sure you're following all the JSON specifications (like no trailing comma on the last item) otherwise it will completely crash. Once you're done, check your dev server again [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and navigate to the `/about` section to verify visually that you've updated the"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
