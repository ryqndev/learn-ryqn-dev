## Overview

Welcome to the first software focused workshop for Design at UCI for the 2023 school year! Here, we'll be exploring some of the basics of web developement fundamentals and seeing how everything connects. This workshop is a slightly adapted version of the original web dev tutorial https://learn.ryqn.dev/article/intro-to-web-dev, and rather than just building a simple click counter, we'll make an API call as well to render some data coming from an outside 3rd party data source. At the very end, we should have learned the basic fundamentals of web development, and have written a web app that will display COVID-19 stats.

### Following along

This write up is meant to supplement the recording of the workshop to help hone main concepts and add in stuff that I may have missed the first time around - so, the various sections I've chosen to break up the recording will be listed with the relevant timestamps.
