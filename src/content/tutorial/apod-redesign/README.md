# Astronomy Picture of the Day Redesign
 

## Overview

We'll be redesigning NASA's Astronomy picture of the day (APOD) and learning how to write the web code for it. We'll be reaching for the usual technologies, HTML/CSS/JS but also use something called an API. The idea is simple: one of NASA's most popular webpages is the APOD - a site that shows a new astronomy-related picture every day with a small snippet written by an astronomer. Since we're likely not astronomers (or atleast not me) nor photographers, we won't be curating a daily astronomy picture for our audience ourselves, but utilizing NASA's database and curated content - more specifically, we'll be using their APOD API.

## Why Redesign?

The main purpose of these tutorials is to show how something might be done so it's less about the *why* and more about the *how*. With that in mind, though, I still only would pick projects that make sense and this one is no different. When we're redesigning something (or maybe even creating something new), the main question I like to ask myself is: `What are the issues with the current thing, and why is my idea an improvement?`

I like the APOD site. I really do. It's cute - but it's old. Like
