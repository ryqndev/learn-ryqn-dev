It is one of the most popular web frameworks and is developed by Facebook. \n\nIf you're using the new (sorta) Facebook / meta??? redesign, that's mostly all written in React. \n\nWeb dev was traditionally all done in plain `HTML/CSS/JS` but as computers got faster, websites could do more things, and that means needing a better way to code dynamic webapps.\n\n\n## Installation and Setup\n\nWe're gonna need 3 things: a place to write code (IDE), a place to run code (Browser), and the React library itself (plus the development environment that comes with it).\n\n### Text Editor / IDE\nJust like regular vanilla web development, we're going to need a text editor of some sort. My IDE of choice is [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), as is for many web developers. I highly, highly, highly recommend VSCode.\n\n### Browser\nAs mentioned earlier, you will need a browser (likely something you already have) but preferably [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) or [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/). Sorry Safari and Internet Explorer lovers. Since we're pretty much developing websites for the browser, we'll need a browser to see what we made. Chrome and Firefox not only have the best debugging experience (personal preference) but also have the most support (fax, no printer). Different browsers have different interpreters and have different support. You can see if a certain feature is supported on a certain browser through [caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com).\n\nHere's an example for writing CSS colors in hex color notation:\n![caniuse snippet for CSS alpha hex code notation](./assets/caniuse.png)\nYou can see that in Safari, it's only supported starting version 10 - which was released in Sept. 26, 2016. This is an example of a pretty well-supported feature but not all features have good compatability. For the purposes of a hackathon or learning web development, testing for browser compatability isn't important but being aware of it is.\n\n### Node, NPM, and React\n\nLastly, you're going to need React but more specifically, the developer environment that can install it easily (as well as other packages you will need). We will need to [install Node and the package manager](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) it comes with - NPM (which funnily enough, does not actually stand for Node Package Manager)\n\nEnsure that the versions you have installed are correct: [Node >= 14.0.0 and npm >= 5.6]\n\nYou can type these commands in a standalone terminal or in the [integrated terminal built into VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/integrated-terminal) to see if you've installed them correctly.\n\n```bash terminal\n$ node -v\nv16.13.0\n\n$ npm -v\n8.1.0\n```\n\n## Test Setup\n\nOnce you've have all of these: VSCode, Browser, and Node/NPM, you're ready to get started on coding React! If you're here for a workshop, read below first. Otherwise, let's first [run through setting up our first React project](https://learn.ryqn.dev/article/creating-your-first-react-project).\n\n### Hack at UCI React Workshop\nNovember 18, 2021 @DBH\n\nIf you're here to just install and setup React for a workshop I'm doing, then you can pretty much stop right here. I'll be skimming through this write up at the start to make sure everyone has this stuff ready if they want to follow along and live code with me. \n\nIf you want to test everything to make sure that you have everything working (completely optional), you can read [the next section](https://learn.ryqn.dev/article/creating-your-first-react-project) to start a quick project. I'll be doing that exact process live during the workshop but if you want to test everything works first, you can check it out. We will also be building from that boilerplate code so it'll be a small headstart if you have it done."}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
