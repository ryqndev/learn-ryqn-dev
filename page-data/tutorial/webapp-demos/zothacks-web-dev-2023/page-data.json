First, we'll learn some basic HTML and Javascript in the first one, and the second part will focus on general design concepts, and how to implement them with CSS.\n\nYou can find a finished version of our codebase here: [Really cool recipe generator source code with just HTML and JS](https://github.com/ryqndev/learn-ryqn-dev/tree/main/src/content/tutorial/webapp-demos/zothacks-web-dev-2023/docs)\n\nAfter the next workshop, we'll add styling and you can see and advance of that source code here: [Really cool recipe generator with styling source code](https://github.com/ryqndev/learn-ryqn-dev/tree/main/src/content/tutorial/webapp-demos/zothacks-web-design-2023/docs)\n\n### Sneak peek\n\n![Recipe app without styling](./assets/recipe-app-without-styling.png)\n![Recipe app with styling](./assets/recipe-app-styled.png)\n\n## Web Dev Basics\n\nFirst, you're going to want to do a quick skim of this brief overview of [HTML, CSS and JS](../../../article/intro-to-web-dev/).\n\n## Other Resources\n\n### Workshops\n\nThese are workshops with recordings attached to them (very similar to this current one) but each one is a different web app idea being executed so essentially these are all variations of this same workshop.\n\n> [Hack at UCI 2023 Workshop](../hack-at-uci-2023)\n> This one goes over both frontend and backend, and connecting the two parts of the codebase. By the end of the workshop, we create a webapp that queries the Yelp API to show restaurants within Irvine\n\n> [Design at UCI 2023 Fall Workshop](../design-at-uci-fall-23)\n> A more visual based workshop that simply calls `disease.sh` and renders the current active COVID cases in California.\n\n### References\n\nSome quick reference articles if you're just trying to do one thing.\n\n> [Using custom fonts](../../../article/how-to-use-fonts)\n> How to find free fonts, import them, and use them in your website\n\n> [Basic Javascript events](../../../tutorial/web-dev/fundamentals/events)\n> Listening to button clicks, getting user text inputs, getting keyboard events\n\n> [Using UI libraries](../../../article/using-web-ui-libraries)\n> How to use a UI library so you get pre-designed components out of the box\n"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
