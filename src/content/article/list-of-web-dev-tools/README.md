# List of web dev tools

Here, I'm compiling a list of popular web development tools that you may have heard of. I've seen a lot of blog posts that rank the "top # web development languages" that really don't make any sense because they're comparing tools that do different things and it confuses beginners. So, I want to go ahead and list the most popular tools that you might've been like "hey, I heard about that and checked it out but no idea what it does or how it works" and explain them and also provide an example of some tech stacks that you could use.
