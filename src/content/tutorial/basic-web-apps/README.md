# Basic Web Apps

## Overview

Here, I have a list of basic web apps that you can make. I personally strongly believe in project driven learning (pretty much how I learned to code) where you essentially learn by creating projects from scratch. I've curated these projects in order of difficulty so that you can try to attempt one after other.

## How to use it

I think the best way to try this is to do most of these projects in order but I also think that if you're not interested in a certain project, don't force yourself to do it. Hopefully, there's enough diverse ideas out here for you to learn everything while still being interested in coding. The last thing you and I want is for you to burn out from coding because I really think there's something out there for everyone.

Every tutorial here should be self-sufficient: meaning that you could technically jump into any one of them and be able to finish it without having to visit another tutorial to understand the whole thing. With that being said, it will make some of the tutorials a little bit redundant so feel free to skip around if you think you understand the concept.

## Requirements

For the first couple projects, the only thing you're going to need to know is basic HTML/CSS/JS. You shouldn't need to use a framework or anything to complex to get it done.
